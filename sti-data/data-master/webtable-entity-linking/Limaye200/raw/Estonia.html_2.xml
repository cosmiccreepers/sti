        <text>Proximity to the Nordic markets, location between Eastern and Western Europe, competitive cost structure and high-skill labour force have been the major Estonian comparative advantages since the 1990s. Estonia has a modern market-based economy and one of the highest per capita income levels in Central Europe . The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland , Sweden and Germany . The current government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt . In 2007, however, a large current account deficit and rising inflation put pressure on Estonia's currency , which is pegged to the euro , highlighting the need for growth in export-generating industries.</text>

        <text>One of the main goals of long-term national development programme of fuel and energy management and goal programme of energy saving is the reduction of environmental impacts. The main tasks in the area are to raise the efficiency of energy production and transport and to use more environment-friendly fuels and reduce special consumption of energy in all branches of economy and households. There are plans to establish new power stations and to provide higher efficiency in oil shale based energy production with the concurrent and significant reduction of the harmful environmental impact via the renovation of combustion technology.</text>

        <text>Although the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have fallen steadily the air is polluted with sulphur dioxide from oil-shale burning power plants in northeast Estonia due the mining industry which was created by the Soviets in early 1950s . In 2000 the emissions were 80% smaller than in 1980 and the amount of unpurified wastewater discharged to water bodies was one twentieth the level of 1980. With the start-up of new water purification plants the pollution load of wastewater has decreased. Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and man-made lakes. The coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations, mainly in East-Estonia.</text>

        <text>high income by the World Bank . Level of the Estonian economy Estonian economic miracle has been often being described as the Baltic Tiger . By 1929, a stable currency, the Kroon (crown) , was established. It is issued by the Bank of Estonia , the country's central bank . Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR . Before the Second World War Estonia was mainly an agriculture country whose products such as butter , milk and cheese was widely known on the western European markets . The USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing Nazi and Soviet destruction during World War II crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war Sovietization of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure.</text>
