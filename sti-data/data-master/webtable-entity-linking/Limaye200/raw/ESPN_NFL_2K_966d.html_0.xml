        <text>ESPN's intros are used for most of the earlier games in the series as menu music but that changed with the introduction of ESPN NFL 2K5. The Soundtrack featured Superstar by Aceyalone, "Drumbox", "Outrun", and "OST Remix" from ...Or Stay Tuned by People Under The Stairs . Another soundtrack that comes with the game are the "bloopers" by the announcers which are really intentional. The player was given an option to choose whether to use ESPN intro music or the custom soundtrack.</text>

        <text>ESPN NFL Primetime 2K2 featuring Edgerrin James on its cover was the last of a long running videogame football series created by Konami . This was the last installment of Primetime football before 2K Sports secured the rights to use the ESPN brandname. All-Pro Football 2K8 , released July 17th , 2007 , is a game that is the revival of the series and uses NFL Legends and fictional teams, some of which are named after defunct football franchises from the AFL , WFL , and United States Football League .</text>

        <text>However, in December 2004 , EA signed an exclusive agreement with the NFL , making Madden NFL the only series allowed to use NFL team and player names. EA also signed an agreement with ESPN to become the only licensee of ESPN's brand in sports games on all platforms. This was an immense blow to Sega's franchise in their MLB , NBA , and NHL series.</text>

        <text>In 2004 , Sega signed a deal with Take-Two Interactive in which Global Star (Take-Two's low-price unit) distributed and co-published all titles in Sega's ESPN franchise. As a result, ESPN NFL 2K5 was priced at $ 19.99 the day it shipped (versus the typical new-release price of $49.99). This earned it a wide audience among more casual football fans on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It was also the first time that the ESPN NFL series managed to grab a significant chunk of market share over the competitor, the Madden NFL series.</text>

        <text>The NFL 2K series was introduced by Sega for its Dreamcast to address EA Sports 's decision not to publish the Madden NFL series on the Dreamcast. The first two installments ( NFL 2K and NFL 2K1 ) were exclusive to the Dreamcast, but with the demise of the Dreamcast, the NFL 2K series was repositioned as the main multiplatform rival to the Madden NFL series. Both series were released on the PlayStation 2 , Xbox , and GameCube . With the cancellation of the NFL GameDay ( 989 Sports ) and NFL Fever ( Microsoft Game Studios ) series in 2003 , NFL 2K (then ESPN NFL Football ) truly became Madden NFL' s primary competition.</text>
