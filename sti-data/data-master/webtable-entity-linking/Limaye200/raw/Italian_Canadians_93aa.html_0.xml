        <text>A second wave occurred after the Second World War when Italians left the war-impoverished country for opportunities in a young and growing country. In the 1960s, immigration laws were again changed, and the bias in favour of Europeans was removed. In the same period, Italy was rapidly growing in wealth, and by the early 1970s fewer Italians were interested in emigration.</text>

        <text>This migration was largely halted by World War I , and new immigration laws in the 1920s limited Italian immigration. During World War II , Italian-Canadians, as well as German-Canadians were regarded with suspicion and faced a great deal of discrimination. Those who had been actively pro-Fascist, and some who were falsely accused, were interned at Camp Petawawa during the war. There was no mass internment as befell Japanese-Canadians , however.</text>

        <text>A substantial influx began in the early twentieth century when over a hundred thousand Italians moved to Canada. These were largely peasants from the poorer southern portion of Italy. They mainly immigrated to Toronto and Montreal , both of which soon had large Italian communities. Smaller communities also arose in Hamilton , Vancouver , Windsor , Niagara Falls and Ottawa . and there is also small communitites in Sherbrooke , QC, Quebec City and Lac-St-Jean. Many also settled in mining communities in British Columbia , Alberta , Cape Breton Island and Northern Ontario . The Northern Ontario cities of Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William were quite heavily populated by Italian immigrants. There was a Royal Commission appointed to Inquire into the Immigration of Italian Labourers to Montreal and alleged Fraudulent Practices of Employment Agencies in 1905, which exposed the abuses of immigration agents known as padroni .</text>

        <text>Italians were among some of the earliest Europeans to migrate to North America. A number of the early explorers such as John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) were Italians. During the New France era, France also occupied parts of Italy and there was a significant Italian presence in the French military forces in the colony. Notable were Alphonse de Tonty , who helped establish Detroit , and Henri de Tonti , who journeyed with La Salle in his exploration of the Mississippi River . Italians made up a small portion of the population, however, and quickly lost their ethnic identities. In 1881, only 1849 Canadians claimed to be Italian. A number of Italians were imported to work as navvies in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway .</text>

        <text>In 2001, about three-quarters of the 1.3 million Canadians of Italian descent (903,375) were born in Canada according to the 2001 Census and 315,455 Canadian residents were born in Italy. Of those 315,000 immigrants, almost half (46.7%) immigrated to Canada before 1961, 38.3% between 1961 and 1970, another 10.3% between 1971 and 1980. Italian immigration to Canada since 1981 has been very slow with only 6.4% of Italian immigrants coming to Canada since 1981.</text>

        <text>An Italian Canadian is a Canadian of Italian descent or heritage. As of the 2006 census, 1,445,335 Canadians (4.6% of total population) consider themselves to be of Italian origin, as well as 4,360 (0.01% of the total population) who considered themselves as Sicilian , according to the 2006 Canadian census. The Italian-Canadian population climbed by more than 12% and half (over 700,000) have combined Italian origins along with another ethnic group, mostly other European ethnic groups. [1] Altogether, Italians continue to be the 6th largest ethnic group in Canada after British and Irish origins, French origin and German origin.</text>
