        <text>This list of minimum wages in Canada collects the minimum wages in Canadian dollars (CAD) set by each province and territory of Canada. Assuming a 40-hour work week for 4.34 weeks a month, the monthly gross incomes of individuals earning the lowest and highest minimum wages in Canada are $1345 and $1519, respectively. Based on current exchange rates, Canadian minimum wages in every jurisdiction are higher than the U.S. federal minimum wage rate of $ 5.85/hour; however, critics of current minimum wage levels in Canada often claim that they are insufficient and advocate that they be raised to what they claim to be the living wage . The New Democratic Party had called for a separate federal minimum wage of $10/hour (higher than any current provincial minimum),</text>

        <text>The federal government in years past has set its own minimum wage rates for workers in federal jurisdiction industries ( railways for example). In 1996, however, the federal minimum wage was re-defined to be the general adult minimum wage rate of the province or territory where the work is performed. This means, for example, that a railway company could not legally pay a worker in British Columbia less than $8/hour regardless of the worker's experience.</text>

        <text>Under the Constitution of Canada , the responsibility for enacting and enforcing labour laws including minimum wages in Canada rests with the ten provinces . The three territories also having been granted this power by virtue of federal legislation. This means that each province and territory has its own minimum wage. The lowest general minimum wages in force as of 2008 are that of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick ( $ 7.75/hour) and the highest is that of Ontario ( $ 8.75/hour). Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to liquor servers and other tip earners, and/or to inexperienced employees. British Columbia allows employers to pay as little as $6/hour to an inexperienced worker.</text>
