The prize is normally a specific bowl game bid for which the conference has a tie-in, or a spot in the BCS (depending on the conference).</text>

        <text>FBS schools are currently limited to a total of 85 football players receiving financial assistance. Since for competitive reasons a student on partial scholarship counts fully against the total of 85, virtually all FBS schools that are not on NCAA probation give 85 full scholarships. The service academies in this context, Army , Navy , and Air Force are exempt from this rule, as all of their students receive full scholarships from the federal government.</text>

        <text>* Of the 16 Big East schools, only eight play football in the conference. Two schools sponsor football teams in the lower Football Championship Subdivision, and one plays football as an independent school. The rest do not play college football. Additionally, the conference features one associate member, Loyola College , which plays women's lacrosse in the Big East. ^ In addition to the 12 full members, Conference USA features three schools, Florida International University , the University of Kentucky , and the University of South Carolina which play men's soccer in the conference. Colorado College , a Division I school in men's ice hockey and a Division III school for all other sports, plays women's soccer in Conference USA. In addition to the 12 full members, the Mid-American Conference features four members who only participate in one sport each: Chicago State University in men's tennis , Hartwick College in men's soccer, Missouri State University in women's field hockey and Temple University in football . # The Pac-10 also includes several associate members who compete in a single sport in the conference; San Diego State University plays men's soccer and six additional schools participate in men's wrestling . $ Only eight schools in the Sun Belt Conference currently sponsor football teams. Two additional schools, Western Kentucky University and University of South Alabama , are scheduled to begin Division I FBS football programs in the future.</text>

        <text>The NCAA has also pushed for Division I FBS schools to be forced to schedule a minimum number of home games each season and meet attendance requirements for those games (see above). This has met with resistance from smaller conferences, whose schools often receive large amounts of money to play road games against schools from the BCS conferences.</text>

        <text>The remaining five conferences, often referred to as " Mid Majors ", do not receive automatic bids but their conference champions are eligible for one of the four remaining "at-large" spots. The one exception is a small group of independents. These teams, Notre Dame in particular, have to be either ranked ahead of a champion from one of the six automatic bid conferences in the BCS standings or rank in the top eight of the BCS standings, to ensure a spot in a BCS bowl game.</text>

        <text>NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as NCAA Division I-A) college football is the only NCAA-sponsored sport without an organized tournament to determine its champion. Schools in Division I FBS compete in post-season bowl games , with the champions of six conferences receiving automatic bids to the highly lucrative Bowl Championship Series to determine a national champion. This is due to many factors, including tradition and certain legal decisions against the NCAA, especially with regard to the sale of television rights.</text>

        <text>For attendance they either will allow the tickets sold or the number of actual people attending the season games as reporting methods. They require a minimum of 15,000 people in attendance for each home game as an average every other year. These numbers get posted to the NCAA statistics website for football each year. In the 2005 football season 14 schools were listed with an average below 15,000. With the new rules starting in the 2006 season, the amount of Bowl subdivision schools could drop in the near future if those schools are not able to pull in enough fans into the games. Additionally, 8 schools in the Championship subdivision had enough attendance to be moved up in 2005.</text>

        <text>The Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly known as I-AA) determines its champion in a 16-team, single-elimination tournament . The champions of eight conferences receive automatic bids to this tournament. However, teams from other conferences are still eligible for one of the eight remaining "at-large" spots. Beginning in 2010, the championship tournament will expand to 20 teams, with ten automatic bids and eight first-round byes.</text>

        <text>The method by which the NCAA determines whether a school is Bowl or Championship subdivision is first by attendance numbers and then by scholarships. Although scholarships are only one of several methods for the NCAA to determine if they have some form of financial backing for the program they do look at attendance as an additional key consideration.</text>
