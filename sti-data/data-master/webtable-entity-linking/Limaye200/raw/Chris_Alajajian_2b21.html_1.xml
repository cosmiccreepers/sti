        <text>At Bathurst on Friday 6 October 2006 Alajajian was involved in an accident that resulted in the death of New Zealand racing driver Mark Porter . Porter's car spun in a section at the top of the mountain and was hit from behind by Alajajian and stalled, sitting sideways on the track. As fellow driver David Clark came around a blind corner he swerved to try and avoid Porter's car but slid sideways into the drivers door. Porter was airlifted to hospital with serious head and chest injuries but passed away in late afternoon of Sunday 8th October as the feature race was concluding. The incident was completely unavoidable as it occurred in a section of track that is blind to following drivers.</text>
